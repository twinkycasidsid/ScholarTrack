# 🎓 ScholarTrack  

ScholarTrack is a **C# desktop application** designed to efficiently manage and track scholars’ library attendance. It provides an automated way to record **time-ins** and **time-outs**, replacing the old paper-based system that was prone to loss and dishonesty.

I created ScholarTrack because paper-based records were such a hassle — they could easily get lost, and some scholars could sign in without actually being present. This system ensures **accuracy, fairness, and transparency** in tracking library attendance.
